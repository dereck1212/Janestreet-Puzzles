In this puzzle, the challenge is to pick three distinct positive integers, A, B, and C, and place them on a 6x6 grid. The objective is to complete two knight’s tours: one from a1 to f6 and the other from a6 to f1, both achieving a total score of exactly 2024 points.

The rules for scoring are:

	•	Start with A points.
	•	For each move:
	•	If the move transitions between different integers, multiply the score by the value moved to.
	•	If the move remains within the same integer value, increment the score by that value.

The puzzle asks you to find values for A, B, and C (with A + B + C less than 50) along with valid knight’s tours that meet the scoring criteria.
